summary: "One of the latest introductions to the schema vocabulary is known as Actions, which focuses on actionable items on a website. While all the existing Schema.org markup is tailored around describing things – like people, organizations, events, and stuff like that – Schema.org is now expanding to include Actions, Potential Actions, and Entry Points this will help websites “to describe the actions they enable and how these actions can be invoked."
