abstract: "Schema.org is a widely adopted vocabulary for semantic annotation of web resources. However, its generic nature makes it complicated for publishers to pick the right types and properties for a specific domain. In this paper, we propose an approach, a domain specification process that generates domain-specific patterns by applying operators implemented in SHACL syntax to the schema.org vocabulary. These patterns can support annotation generation and verification processes for specific domains. We provide tooling for the generation of such patterns and evaluate the usability of both domain-specific patterns and the tools with use cases in the tourism domain."
