abstract: "Knowledge graphs are only useful if they satisfy the requirements of those applications in terms of quality. In this in-use experience paper, we present our approach and tools for supporting the knowledge graph Lifecycle that starts with creation and hosting and continues with the curation and deployment. The curation process enables the maintenance of a knowledge graph, especially in terms of correctness and completeness. We provide process models and evaluation of developed tools with Knowledge Graphs in the tourism domain. We discuss the lessons learned from implementing such an approach in an open and commercial setting in several use cases."
