Schema.org contains an [Action](https://schema.org/Action) type to provide a mechanism to define actions that can be take on entities. In the context of schema.org, the actions are quite generic. For example, the [Action](https://schema.org/Action) type includes properties like **startTime** and **endTime** to describe the time span an action occurred or the **location** property to describe where the action took place. We restrict and extend the properties defined for the [Action](https://schema.org/Action) type and consequently its subtypes in order to make them more specific to a Web API annotation task.
The table below shows the properties of Action type that are relevant for the WASA language.

|    **Property**    |            **Range**            | **Description** |
|:--------------:|:---------------------------:|:-----------:|
|  actionStatus  |       ActionStatusType      |           Indicates the current disposition of the Action.  |
|     object     |            Thing            |       The object upon which the action is carried out, whose state is kept intact or changed. Also known as the semantic roles patient, affected or undergoer (which change their state) or theme (which doesn't). e.g. John read a book.      |
|     result     |            Thing            |      The result produced in the action. e.g. John wrote a book.       |
|     target     |          EntryPoint         |      Indicates a target EntryPoint for an Action.       |
