However, its generic nature makes it complicated for publishers to pick the right types and properties for a specific domain. In this paper, we propose an approach, a domain specification process that generates domain-specific patterns by applying operators implemented in SHACL syntax to the schema.org vocabulary. These patterns can support annotation generation and verification processes for specific domains. We provide tooling for the generation of such patterns and evaluate the usability of both domain-specific patterns and the tools with use cases in the tourism domain.","tags":["SHACL","schema.org","semantic annotation","domain-specifc patterns"],"title":"Domain-Specific Customization of Schema.Org Based on SHACL","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Umutcan Simsek"],"categories":[],"content":"The concept of \u0026ldquo;browsing the web\u0026rdquo; is being replaced by automated agents that access to structured content.

These new communication channels present a new challenge for successful e-Marketing and e-Commerce providers. Data, content, and services are becoming semantically annotated, allowing software agents, so-called bots, to search through the web and understand its content. Nowadays, users typically consult their bot to find, aggregate, and personalize information and to reserve, book, or buy products and services. As a consequence, it is becoming increasingly important for touristic providers of information, products, and services to be prominently visible in these new online channels to ensure their future economic maturity. In our chapter, we survey the methods and tools helping to achieve these goals. The core aim is the development and application of machine-processable (semantic) annotations of content, data, and services, as well as their aggregation in large Knowledge Graphs. It is only through these methods bots are able to answer a question in a knowledgeable way and organize a useful dialogue (Knowledge Graphs in Use A significantly extended and generalized version of this article will appear as D.

Chapter 1 defines knowledge graphs, focusing on the impact of various approaches rather than mathematical precision. Chapter 2 details how knowledge graphs are built, implemented, maintained, and deployed. Chapter 3 then introduces relevant application layers that can be built on top of such knowledge graphs, and explains how inference can be used to define views on such graphs, making it a useful resource for open and service-oriented dialog systems. Chapter 4 discusses applications of knowledge graph technologies for e-tourism and use cases for other verticals. Lastly, Chapter 5 provides a summary and sketches directions for future work.

The number of semantic annotations on the web are increasing, mostly due to the industrial incentives provided by those search engines. The annotations are not only consumed by search engines, but also by other automated agents like intelligent personal assistants (IPAs). However, only annotating data is not enough for automated agents to reach their full potential. Web APIs should also be annotated for automating service consumption, so the IPAs can complete tasks like booking a hotel room or buying a ticket for an event on the fly. Although there has been a vast amount of effort in the semantic web services field, the approaches did not gain too much adoption outside of academia, mainly due to lack of concrete incentives and steep learning curves. In this paper, we suggest a lightweight, bottom-up approach based on schema.org actions to annotate Web APIs. We analyse schema.org vocabulary in the scope of lightweight semantic web services literature and propose extensions where necessary.
